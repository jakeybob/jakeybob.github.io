# Bob Taylor


Hullo! This is one of those pages that people have, which is kind of like a CV or resumé. In any case, my face is to the left, some general information is below, and more details can be found by tapping on the links.

## Summary

I currently work at [Public Health Scotland](https://publichealthscotland.scot) as an analyst, with experience in various public health topics – COVID-19 epidemiology / modelling, socio-economic analysis, dashboards / visualisation, GIS / spatio-temporal research, agent-based modelling etc. I come from an astrophysics background, so I also have extremely general transferrable skills like non-linear optical field simulation, control systems, digital electronics, mechanical engineering / CAD, ultra-sensitive laser interferometry, and hanging-upside-down-in vacuum-tanks-while-soldering-things.

I mostly code in *R* and *Julia*, and have used *Python* and *MATLAB* extensively.
