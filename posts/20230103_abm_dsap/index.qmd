Recently I got the chance to investigate how to write agent-based models using Julia, and the Agents.jl library. Lots more detail (as well as code etc) [here](https://github.com/jakeybob/abm-dsap) ... but it was pretty easy to set up a simulation of a populated space, include pathfinding for agents...

... and then use this to record the time and place where infected agents (coloured *red* in the animation) transmit their disease to uninfected (in *blue*) agents.
